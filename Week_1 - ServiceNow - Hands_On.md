## Now Platform Architecture
When you purchase an instance, it is ServiceNow's responsibility to support the IT infrastructure and compute resources needed to enable and secure that instance.
- Enterprise Cloud
  - Most cloud services are built on a multi-tenant architecture in which your platform and data are co-mingled with other companies. ServiceNOw is build on a **multi-instance architecture**. You have your own instance of the platform and database.
- Availability & Redundancy
  - All ServiceNow datacenters are paired with another datacenter to provide redundancy and failover. **Redundancy is built into every layer** including devices, power, and network resources.
- Backups & Security
  - ServiceNow provides **4 weekly full data backups** and **6 days of daily differential backups**. The entire platform is secured using multiple technologies which have been certified by third-party security organizations.
- Domain Separation(multi-tenancy)
  - The ServiceNow platform provides the ability to separate data, and administrative tasks on an instance into logical groupings called domains.
    - All users can potentially see records from the 'global domain', but only users who belong to a domain can see domain-specific records.

**1. Banner Frame**
- It consists of several menus such as All menu, Filter Navigator, Pinning menus, History menu, Workspaces menu.
  - _ALL menu_
    - The All menu provides access to all applications and modules they contain. An application is a group of modules (or pages) that provide related information and functionality in an instance. For example, you'll work in the Incident application in this course, which contains modules for creating and viewing incidents.

  - _Filter Navigator_
    - The Filter Navigator is where you can quickly navigate to applications and modules. Simply begin by typing the application or module name (all, or part of, any module name). For example, if you were to search Service Catalog, you can start to type, "Service Cat" and all applications with the keyword will display.

  - _Adding and customizing favorites_
    - Selecting the star icon next to an application or module will create a Favorite menu item. Favorites can be re-ordered, edited, or removed from the menu by selecting the Edit (pencil) icon. 
To re-order a favorite item, select the pencil icon first to edit it, then click and drag the item (or select the icon with six dots) to whichever order you'd like! 
To change the name, color, and icon of a favorited item, select the item and change one or all three options! 
While editing a favorited item, don't forget to Save your edits (select Save edits) before exiting the Edit your favorites window.

  - _History Menu_
    - Select the History menu, then select any recent activity to open the item in the Content Frame. By default, the maximum number of items displayed in the History tab is 30. 
The system creates history entries for many types of content including lists, records, and homepages. Some content types are not tracked in the history, such as UI pages and other non-standard interfaces.
